        <h1>The <i>Pain</i> Agency</h1>

        <h3>🤨 <i>Who?</i></h3>

        <p>
            
            Hi, I'm jjj333_p, however you can call me Joe. I am 17 and a college student based in the usa,
            and i love to fuck around with technology, however it doesnt love me. I host a private homeserver using this domain 
            (I'm <a style="color: green;" href="https://matrix.to/#/@jjj333:pain.agency">@jjj333:pain.agency</a>).
            I would love to open up regis someday, but I'm waiting for dendrite to have adequate administration endpoints.
            For now I am trying to host some public matrix bridges, given that I can do that in a fairly responsibility-free way.

            <br><br>

            I clearly have no idea what I am doing with web dev, this site is my first time touching it at all, however I suppose for many a plain
            html page is actually refreshing.

            <br><br>

            I support the alphabet mafia as a member myself, but regardless I support people being themselves and making life what they want it to be.
            I believe that we should all be able to live life free to persue happiness, however that looks for any given person, as long as it doesn't 
            impact anyone else's ability to have and do the same.

            <br><br><br>

        </p>

        <h3>📲 Contact:</h3>

        <p>

            These are the different platforms I can be contacted on, in order of preference. If you dont find an account on this list, it isnt me,
            and even on the off chance that it is me I won't expect you to believe or try to convince you that it is me.

                        Signal - this probably isn't a great option because while I do love signal, I already have my private number on
                        my main phone so this public phone number lives on a secondary phone that I only check once in a while.
